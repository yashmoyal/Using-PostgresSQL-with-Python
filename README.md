# Using-PostgresSQL-with-Python

## As a data Engineer, Sometimes you have to work with SQL using Python that is instead of using SQL through its SQL-SHELL or UI.
## So, this project tells you how to work with SQL using python programming language.
### **************************************************************************************************************
# Let's go through the steps and the tools required to make this project
# Tools Used: 
##    1. Python 3.10
##    2. Jupyter Netebook
##    3. Psycopg2 (Library to use SQL with Python)
##    4. Pandas ( for Creating Dataframe and do some EDA)

## First find the dataset to be inserted in SQL.(For this project we use the Commonwealth2022 Dataset from kaggle). Find Dataset [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varunnagpalspyz/commonwealth-games-2022).

## All the Steps Releated to this project can be found in the .ipynb file itself.

## Thank-you
